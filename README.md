## Title:
Software Engineering Bootcamp
Project 1: Basic Business or Personal Website

## Name:
Joshua D. Needham

## Overview:
 This project is a website I built for my Software Engineering Bootcamp. It highlights Sacramento-area running events, with pages for each race, event details, and a simple registration form. The goal is to practice structuring a multi-page site with HTML and CSS, apply a CSS framework, and integrate a third-party service for handling form submissions. The site is framed as a community-driven project to provide clear, accessible information for runners in Sacramento, Davis, and Clarksburg.

## How to Use / Functionality:
- Homepage showcases the next event
- Navigate via the global Navigation Bar at the top of each page.
- Browse events by "Location" or "Distance" on the 'Events' page.
- Each event has its own page with:
    - Event details (date, location, description).
    - A mock registration form with required inputs (first name, email, distance, shirt size, waiver agreement).
    - Registration submissions (as well as the 'Contact' page) are handled via Formspree, and participants pay in cash on race day at the event (no e-commerce set up currently).

## Technologies Used:
- HTML: skeleton of the pages
- CSS: (Bootstrap + Bootswatch Vapor theme + custom styles) for layout and design
- JavaScript: (via Bootstrapâ€™s bundled scripts for interactivity).
- Formspree: form collection
- GitHub: repository and site hosting (GitHub Pages)

## Ideas for Future Improvement:
1. Add e-commerce integration for race fees (like Stripe or PayPal).
2. Build a database-backed for managing race registrations.
3. Add dynamic filtering and searching for events by location/date/distance.
4. Include maps and routes for each event.
5. Implement user accounts so runners can track past and upcoming races.
6. Create a calendar and possibly a scheduling assistant for users.
